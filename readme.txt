Copy the menu name exactly as you set under Appearance->Menus->Your selected menu.

= Highlight Text Contents =

Use shortcode to highlight any text snippet with animation inside your blog post or WordPres pages. Helpful to draw user attention to particular text or paragraph that are deemed important by the admin. Supports different types of highlight animation shortcodes including highlight text on hover.

<strong> Speed reading or Bionic Reading </strong>

Speed reading is a Pro version feature for now. We are working on bringing this feature to the free version soon!

Speed reading is the process of rapidly recognizing and absorbing phrases or sentences on a page all at once, rather than identifying individual words. This feature is available with the Highlight Pro version. With speed reading humans are capable of absorbing information at speeds much faster than standard reading rates with the same level of comprehension.

Allow your website users to convert blog or article text from your webpage into the bionic reading style. Converting the first half of each word to bold text improves reading speed for most readers!
